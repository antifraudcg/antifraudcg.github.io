      [DRAFT] Anti-Fraud Community Group Charter
    </h1>
    <p>
      This Charter is work in progress. To submit feedback, please use
      <a href="https://github.com/antifraudcg/antifraudcg.github.io/issues">
      https://github.com/antifraudcg/antifraudcg.github.io/issues</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="goals">
      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The mission of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/antifraud/">Anti
      Fraud Community Group</a> is to identify and define scenarios involving
      fraud and unwanted traffic, as well as to incubate and develop web
      features and APIs to address those scenarios while being mindful of user
      security, privacy, and accessibility. Fraud and unwanted traffic can
      include web activity perpetrated by botnets, attackers impersonating
      users, and other activity that intends to deceive and harm users or
      compromise web services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group welcomes participation from anti-fraud service providers,
      common targets of unwanted traffic, browser vendors, privacy advocates,
      web application developers, web hosting and cloud service providers, and
      other interested parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Community Group will discuss issues that server operators (network
      and web server admins) and anti-fraud service providers face in this
      area, as well as ideas for new web features, protocols, and APIs intended
      for browsers or similar user agents.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scope-of-work">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Community Group will discuss and document various forms of fraudulent
      activity on the web, to establish a foundation for developing web APIs
      that assist in our mission. The focus is to enable scaled anti-fraud and
      solutions that are applicable across the ecosystem. 
    </p>
    <h3 id="out-of-scope">
      Out of Scope
    </h3>
    <p>
      Carve-outs (exceptions to restrictions/limitations) for other web
      platform work should be brought up in the appropriate group, rather than
      as part of the Anti-Fraud CG. Features which don’t interact with the
      browser (or similar user agent) should be proposed in other standards
      bodies (IETF, etc).
    </p>
    <h2 id="meetings">
      Meetings
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meetings will be held biweekly on {TODO: INSERT DATE}, lasting for one
      hour. Meetings will be run by one of the Chairs, who will request scribes
      to take meeting notes that will be made publicly available in the
      <a href="https://github.com/antifraudcg/meetings">Meetings</a> repository
       after the meeting. Any action items from the meeting will also be posted
       to the Community Group mailing list to bring them to the attention of
       people who did not attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Infrequently, face-to-face meetings will be held for the Anti-Fraud
      Community Group, allowing for more collaboration and iteration between
      Community Group members.
    </p>
    <h2 id="deliverables">
      Deliverables
    </h2>
    <h3 id="work-items">
      Current Work Items
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are currently no work items that have been adopted by the Community
      Group. See <a href="#proposals">Proposals</a> for the process of adopting
      a proposal into the Community Group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a work item is ready for standardization and there is
      <a href="#decision">consensus</a> that the work item is ready to
      be migrated to a standards body, the Chairs will collaborate with the
      Community Group to prepare a Community Group Report on the item, and work
      with the Editors to disseminate it to the appropriate standards body.
    </p>
    <h3 id="proposals">
      Proposals
    </h3>
    <p>
      Anyone can submit proposals to the
      <a href="https://github.com/antifraudcg/proposals/">proposals repository</a>.
      If there is substantial documentation/work, the proposal authors can
      request the Chairs set-up a dedicated repository for a proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A proposal can be withdrawn by its authors, or closed if there's
      consensus that the proposal is out of scope or the number of authors has
      dropped to zero. The Chairs will check-in with active proposals to ensure
      the set of active authors is kept up-to-date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally proposals should include an <i>Explainer</i> document describing
      the changes to the web platform and impact of the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work items are proposals that have community group support and result in
      a deliverable, either as interoperable standards/APIs or documentation.
      Once a proposal is in a state for the community group to work on, it
      should be proposed for adoption as a work item. To be adopted as a work
      item, a proposal should be sent out to the CG mailing list, and there
      must be at least two supporters of the proposal. For work items intended
      to become a web-exposed API, at least one supporter should be a browser
      vendor (as an indication of interest in implementation).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chairs should work with the authors to determine whether the work
      item is within the scope of the CG and that there is sufficient
      likelihood that the work item will be implemented in the ecosystem. If
      consensus is established, the proposal will be adopted as an official
      work item of the CG. Editors will be assigned to the work item, generally
      the proposal authors.
    </p>

    <h2 id="process">
      Community and Business Group Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the
      Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request to
      participate without representing their organization's legal interests,
      W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the
      following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to
      make a contribution to a group <a href="#deliverables">Deliverable</a>.
      The section on <a href="#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes
      how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of
      Ethics and Professional Conduct</a> applies to participation in
      this group.
    </p>

    <h2 id="contrib">
      Contribution Mechanics
    </h2>
    <p>
      Substantive Contributions to Specifications can only be made by Community
      Group Participants who have agreed to the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications created in the Community Group must use the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a>. All other documents produced by
      the group should use that License where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the
      GitHub repo the group is using for the particular document. This may be
      in the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by
      adding a comment to an existing issue.
    </p>
    <p id="githublicense">
      All Github repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a
      copy of the <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a>
      and <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-LICENSE.md">LICENSE</a>
      files.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transparency">
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. All technical
      work will occur in the group's GitHub repositories (and not in mailing
      list discussions). This is to ensure contributions can be tracked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public
      summary or minutes will be posted to the
      <a href="https://github.com/antifraudcg/meetings">Meetings</a> repository.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus.
      Actions/proposals that require consensus should be proposed publicly on
      the group's mailing list. The chairs should provide ample time for
      participants to voice concern (7+ days).
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is no sustained opposition, then an action will proceed.
      Opposition can be expressed explicitly via the mailing list or to the
      Chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is sustained opposition without changes to the issue, and the
      proposer still wishes to proceed, the Chairs will hold an approval vote in the
      Community Group. Each organization will have one vote. This is only to
      be used as a last resort if consensus can’t be reached and no progress
      is being made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in a GitHub Issue. Any group participant may object to a decision reached
      at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of the
      decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their
      objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the
      objection according to the <a href="#decision">decision process</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
      or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.
    </p>

      Community Group Chairs
    </h2>
    <h3 id="out-of-scope">
      Chair Responsibilities
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Chairs of the Community Group have the following responsibilities. In
      the case of multiple Chairs, they should ensure that at least one Chair
      is responsible for each item.
      <ul>
        <li>Organize/run virtual and face-to-face meetings/conferences.</li>
        <li>Encourage/solicit participation in the Community Group.</li>
        <li>Maintain GitHub organizations/repositories.</li>
        <li>Triage and respond to general issues on the repositories.</li>
        <li>Ensure compliance with the W3C CG/BG Process and CLA.</li>
        <li>Uphold the processes and scope determined by the CG charter.</li>
        <li>Mediate contentious CG issues.</li>
        <li>Determine whether the CG has consensus on actions/issues.</li>
        <li>Coordinate with other W3C and external groups.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 id="chair-selection">
      Chair Selection
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Community Group can have up to three Chairs, no more than one per
      organization. Additional Chairs may be appointed by unanimous consent of
      the then-current Chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the number of Chairs falls to zero, or if four Community Group
      Participants — from different organizations — call for an election, the
      group must use the following process to elect a new Chair, as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Participants announce their candidacies</b>: Participants have 14 days
      to announce their candidacies. No two candidates can be from the same
      organization. If there are three or fewer candidates, they become the
      Chairs. If there are more than three candidates, a vote is held. (If
      there are no candidates, the Community Development Lead should be
      consulted for guidance).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Participants vote</b>: The individuals who receive the most votes, no
      two from the same organization, are elected Chairs. Individuals are
      selected until there are a total of three Chairs. In case of a tie,
      <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2777">RFC2777</a> is
      used to break the tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or seven days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive two-thirds of the votes cast in the
      approval vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the
      charter such as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process
      rather than this charter amendment process. The group will use the
      amendment process for any substantive changes to the goals, scope,
      deliverables, decision process or rules for amending the charter.

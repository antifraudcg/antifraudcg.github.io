      [DRAFT] Anti-Fraud Community Group Charter
    </h1>
    <p>
      This Charter is work in progress. To submit feedback, please use
      <a href="https://github.com/antifraudcg/antifraudcg.github.io/issues">

    <h2 id="goals">
      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The mission of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/antifraud/">Anti
      Fraud Community Group</a> is to identify and define scenarios involving
      fraud and abuse, such as unwanted traffic, as well as to incubate and 
      develop web features and APIs to address those scenarios while supporting
      user security, privacy, and accessibility. Fraud and abuse can include
      web activity perpetrated by botnets, attackers impersonating
      users, unwanted traffic, and other activity that intends to deceive and
      harm users or compromise web services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group welcomes participation from anti-abuse service providers,
      common targets of unwanted traffic, browser vendors, privacy advocates,
      web application developers, web hosting and cloud service providers, and
      other interested parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Community Group will discuss issues that server operators (network
      and web server admins) and anti-fraud service providers face in this
      area, as well as ideas for new web features, protocols, and APIs intended
      for and that interface with browsers or similar user agents.
    </p>
    <p class=note>
      The current definition of abuse is left broad, with the intent that the
      Charter will be amended in the future once further use case work items
      are adopted by the Community Group.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scope-of-work">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Community Group will discuss and document various forms of fraudulent
      activity on the web, as well as the properties of such activities that
      lend themselves to abuse, to establish a foundation for developing web APIs
      that assist in our mission. The focus is to enable scaled anti-fraud and
      solutions that are applicable across the ecosystem. 
    </p>
    <h3 id="out-of-scope">
      Out of Scope
    </h3>
    <p>
      Carve-outs (exceptions to restrictions/limitations) for other web
      platform work should be brought up in the appropriate group, rather than
      as part of the Anti-Fraud CG. Features which don't interact at all with
      the browser (or similar user agent) should be proposed in other standards
      bodies (IETF, etc).
    </p>
    <h2 id="meetings">
      Meetings
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meetings will be held biweekly on Friday 12 PM EST/ 9AM PST / 5PM GMT,
      lasting for one hour. Meetings will be run by one of the Chairs, who will
      request scribes to take meeting notes that will be made publicly available
      in the <a href="https://github.com/antifraudcg/meetings">Meetings</a>
      repository after the meeting. Any action items from the meeting will also
      be posted to the Community Group mailing list to bring them to the attention
      of people who did not attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Infrequently, face-to-face meetings will be held for the Anti-Fraud
      Community Group, allowing for more collaboration and iteration between
      Community Group members.

    <h3 id="work-items">
      Current Work Items
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are currently no work items that have been adopted by the Community
      Group. See <a href="#proposals">Proposals</a> for the process of adopting
      a proposal into the Community Group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a work item is ready for standardization and there is
      <a href="#decision">consensus</a> that the work item is ready to
      be migrated to a standards body, the Chairs will collaborate with the
      Community Group to prepare a Community Group Report on the item, and work
      with the Editors to disseminate it to the appropriate standards body.
    </p>
    <h3 id="proposals">
      Proposal and Work Item Lifecycle
    </h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          New Proposal - A document put forward by a group of <b>author(s)</b>
          to be considered by the CG. Any participant may submit proposals to
          the <a href="https://github.com/antifraudcg/proposals/">proposals
          repository</a>. If there is substantial documentation/work, the
          proposal authors can ask the Chairs to set up a dedicated repository
          for a proposal. Proposals should generally include an Explainer
          document describing the changes to the web platform and impact of the
          proposal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Closed Proposal - A document that has been withdrawn from
          consideration of the CG (1) by the author(s), or (2) if the number of
          authors has dropped to zero, or (3) by CG consensus that the proposal
          is out of scope. The Chairs will check-in with active proposals to
          ensure the set of active authors is kept up-to-date.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Proposals that have community group support and result in a deliverable
      &mdash;either as interoperable standards/APIs or documentation&mdash; can
      become CG work items.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Proposed Work Item - A document proposed to become a CG work item. To
          be adopted as a work item, a proposal should be sent out to the CG
          mailing list, and there must be at least two supporters of the
          proposal. For work items intended to become a web-exposed API, at
          least one supporter should be a browser vendor (as an indication of
          interest in implementation). Chairs should work with the authors to
          help ensure that a proposed work item is within the scope of the CG
          and that there is sufficient likelihood that the work item will be
          implemented in the ecosystem.
        </li>
        <li>
          Work Item - When consensus has been established, proposed work items
          become official work items of the CG for further iteration, driven by
          a group of assigned <b>editor(s)</b> who are generally the proposal
          authors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Completed Work Item - A document that the CG is satisfied with and may
          be sent on to a working group for standardization.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 id="process">
      Community and Business Group Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the
      Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request to
      participate without representing their organization's legal interests,
      W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the
      following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to
      make a contribution to a group <a href="#deliverables">Deliverable</a>.
      The section on <a href="#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes
      how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of
      Ethics and Professional Conduct</a> applies to participation in
      this group.
    </p>

    <h2 id="contrib">
      Contribution Mechanics
    </h2>
    <p>
      Substantive Contributions to Specifications can only be made by Community
      Group Participants who have agreed to the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications created in the Community Group must use the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a>. All other documents produced by
      the group should use that License where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the
      GitHub repo the group is using for the particular document. This may be
      in the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by
      adding a comment to an existing issue.
    </p>
    <p id="githublicense">
      All Github repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a
      copy of the <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a>
      and <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-LICENSE.md">LICENSE</a>
      files.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transparency">
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. All technical
      work will occur in the group's GitHub repositories (and not in mailing
      list discussions). This is to ensure contributions can be tracked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public
      summary or minutes will be posted to the
      <a href="https://github.com/antifraudcg/meetings">Meetings</a> repository.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus.
      Actions/proposals that require consensus should be proposed publicly on
      the group's mailing list. The chairs should provide ample time for
      participants to voice concern (7+ days).
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is no sustained opposition, then an action will proceed.
      Opposition can be expressed explicitly via the mailing list or to the
      Chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is sustained opposition without changes to the issue, and the
      proposer still wishes to proceed, the Chairs will hold an approval vote in the
      Community Group. Each organization will have one vote. This is only to
      be used as a last resort if consensus can’t be reached and no progress
      is being made. Generally an approval vote requires simple majority, though
      amendments to the Charter will require two-thirds majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in a GitHub Issue. Any group participant may object to a decision reached
      at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of the
      decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their
      objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the
      objection according to the <a href="#decision">decision process</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
      or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.
    </p>

      Community Group Chairs
    </h2>
    <h3 id="chair-responsibilities">
      Chair Responsibilities
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Chairs of the Community Group have the following responsibilities. In
      the case of multiple Chairs, they should ensure that at least one Chair
      is responsible for each item.
      <ul>
        <li>Organize/run virtual and face-to-face meetings/conferences.</li>
        <li>Encourage/solicit participation in the Community Group.</li>
        <li>Maintain GitHub organizations/repositories.</li>
        <li>Triage and respond to general issues on the repositories.</li>
        <li>Ensure compliance with the W3C CG/BG Process and CLA.</li>
        <li>Uphold the processes and scope determined by the CG charter.</li>
        <li>Mediate contentious CG issues.</li>
        <li>Determine whether the CG has consensus on actions/issues.</li>
        <li>Coordinate with other W3C and external groups.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 id="chair-selection">
      Chair Selection
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Community Group can have up to three Chairs, no more than one per
      organization. Additional Chairs may be appointed by unanimous consent of
      the then-current Chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the number of Chairs falls to zero, or if four Community Group
      Participants — from different organizations — call for an election, the
      group must use the following process to elect a new Chair, as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Participants announce their candidacies</b>: Participants have 14 days
      to announce their candidacies. No two candidates can be from the same
      organization. If there are three or fewer candidates, they become the
      Chairs. If there are more than three candidates, a vote is held. (If
      there are no candidates, the Community Development Lead should be
      consulted for guidance).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Participants vote</b>: Each organization will have a single ballot
      that can be used to selected any number of candidates, as a form of
      multiwinner approval voting. The three candidates with the most
      votes at the conclusion of the vote are appointed chairs. In case of a
      tie, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2777">RFC2777</a>
      is used to break the tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <p class=note>
      The Community Development Lead is a member of W3C staff chosen by W3C
      leadership to manage the Community Groups program. As of the drafting
      of this charter, the Community Development Lead was
      <a href=https://www.w3.org/People/functions/w3m#dom>Dominique
      Hazaël-Massieux</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The group may make simple corrections and other amendments to the charter
      by establishing group consensus. The new charter, if approved, takes
      effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself, or seven days
      after consensus has been established or the results of the vote have been
      announced, whichever is later.
